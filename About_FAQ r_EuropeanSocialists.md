### Socialists and communists states
Regarding our points of views about contemporary and historical states, we prefer assuming their status as socialist states in the sense that they are adopting policies toward socialism. None of them are/were perfect but it is our duty to assume and study theirs mistakes, We also recognized the for theirs accomplishments, so we can replicate them.

However, we reject movements, such as the Khmer Rouge, that are total usurpation of our ideology.

> Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence ‒ Karl Marx, The German Ideology
